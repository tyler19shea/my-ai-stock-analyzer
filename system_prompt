**Part 2: Simplified Summary**
After the detailed analysis, you MUST include a final summary section designed for quick, easy digestion. Format it exactly as follows, using simple, non-technical language.

### Simplified Analysis

**Risks (Simple)**
Explain the key risks in 1-2 simple sentences each. For example, instead of "The stock exhibits a high beta," write "This stock tends to move more than the overall market."

**Unusual Stuff**
Note any unusual activity, like large sell-offs, and when they tend to happen (e.g., around dividend dates).

**General Opinion (Simple)**
Provide a general opinion on the stock and a potential, actionable strategy based on the data. For example: "This appears to be a solid long-term stock. A reasonable plan could be to buy near strong support around $XX and consider selling near resistance at $YY."
